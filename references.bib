abstract = {Abstract Hydration free energy (HFE) is generally used for evaluating molecular solubility, which is an important property for pharmaceutical and chemical engineering processes. Accurately predicting HFE is also recognized as one fundamental capability of molecular mechanics force field. Here, we present a systematic investigation on HFE calculations with AMOEBA polarizable force field at various parameterization and simulation conditions. The HFEs of seven small organic molecules have been obtained alchemically using the Bennett Acceptance Ratio method. We have compared two approaches to derive the atomic multipoles from quantum mechanical calculations: one directly from the new distributed multipole analysis and the other involving fitting to the electrostatic potential around the molecules. Wave functions solved at the MP2 level with four basis sets (6-311G*, 6-311++G(2d,2p), cc-pVTZ, and aug-cc-pVTZ) are used to derive the atomic multipoles. HFEs from all four basis sets show a reasonable agreement with experimental data (root mean square error 0.63 kcal/mol for aug-cc-pVTZ). We conclude that aug-cc-pVTZ gives the best performance when used with AMOEBA, and 6-311++G(2d,2p) is comparable but more efficient for larger systems. The results suggest that the inclusion of diffuse basis functions is important for capturing intermolecular interactions. The effect of long-range correction to van der Waals interaction on the hydration free energies is about 0.1 kcal/mol when the cutoff is 12Å, and increases linearly with the number of atoms in the solute/ligand. In addition, we also discussed the results from a hybrid approach that combines polarizable solute with fixed-charge water in the HFE calculation. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem, 2011},

abstract = {Cells use homeostatic mechanisms to ensure an optimal composition of distinct types of lipids in cellular membranes. The hydrophilic region of biological lipid membranes is mainly composed of several types of phospholipid headgroups that interact with incoming molecules, nanoparticles, and viruses, whereas the hydrophobic region consists of a distribution of acyl chains and sterols affecting membrane fluidity/rigidity related properties and forming an environment for membrane-bound molecules such as transmembrane proteins. A fundamental open question is to what extent the motions of these regions are coupled and, consequently, how strongly the interactions of phospholipid headgroups with other molecules depend on the properties and composition of the membrane hydrophobic core. We combine advanced solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with high-fidelity molecular dynamics simulations to demonstrate how the rotational dynamics of choline headgroups remain nearly unchanged (slightly faster) with incorporation of cholesterol into a phospholipid membrane, contrasting the well-known extreme slowdown of the other phospholipid segments. Notably, our results suggest a new paradigm in which phospholipid dipole headgroups interact as quasi-freely rotating flexible dipoles at the interface, independent of the properties in the hydrophobic region.}

abstract  ="Despite the vast amount of experimental and theoretical studies on the binding affinity of cations – especially the biologically relevant Na+ and Ca2+ – for phospholipid bilayers{,} there is no consensus in the literature. Here we show that by interpreting changes in the choline headgroup order parameters according to the ‘molecular electrometer’ concept [Seelig et al.{,} Biochemistry{,} 1987{,} 26{,} 7535]{,} one can directly compare the ion binding affinities between simulations and experiments. Our findings strongly support the view that in contrast to Ca2+ and other multivalent ions{,} Na+ and other monovalent ions (except Li+) do not specifically bind to phosphatidylcholine lipid bilayers at sub-molar concentrations. However{,} the Na+ binding affinity was overestimated by several molecular dynamics simulation models{,} resulting in artificially positively charged bilayers and exaggerated structural effects in the lipid headgroups. While qualitatively correct headgroup order parameter response was observed with Ca2+ binding in all the tested models{,} no model had sufficient quantitative accuracy to interpret the Ca2+:lipid stoichiometry or the induced atomistic resolution structural changes.

Bilayer parameters, such as area per lipid and overall bilayer thickness have been obtained in conjunction with intrabilayer structural parameters (e.g. hydrocarbon region thickness). The results have allowed us to assess the effect of temperature and hydrocarbon chain composition on bilayer structure. For example, we found that for all lipids there is, not surprisingly, an increase in fatty acid chain trans–gauche isomerization with increasing temperature. Moreover, this increase in trans–gauche isomerization scales with fatty acid chain length in mixed chain lipids. However, in the case of lipids with saturated fatty acid chains, trans–gauche isomerization is increasingly tempered by attractive chain–chain van der Waals interactions with increasing chain length. Finally, our results confirm a strong dependence of lipid chain dynamics as a function of double bond position along fatty acid chains.}

The neutron data for DOPC included two solvent contrasts, 50% and 100% D2O. For DPPC, additional contrast data were obtained with deuterated analogs DPPC_d62, DPPC_d13, and DPPC_d9. For the analysis, we developed a model that is based on volume probability distributions and their spatial conservation. The model's design was guided and tested by a DOPC molecular dynamics simulation. The model consistently captures the salient features found in both electron and neutron scattering density profiles. A key result of the analysis is the molecular surface area, A. For DPPC at 50°C A=63.0Å2, whereas for DOPC at 30°C A=67.4Å2, with estimated uncertainties of 1Å2. Although A for DPPC agrees with a recently reported value obtained solely from the analysis of x-ray scattering data, A for DOPC is almost 10% smaller. This improved method for determining lipid areas helps to reconcile long-standing differences in the values of lipid areas obtained from stand-alone x-ray and neutron scattering experiments and poses new challenges for molecular dynamics simulations.}

    abstract = "{A simple treatment for incorporating induced polarization in computer simulations is formulated on the basis of the classical Drude oscillator model. In this model, electronic induction is represented by the displacement of a charge-carrying massless particle attached to a polarizable atom under the influence of the local electric field. The traditional self-consistent field (SCF) regime of induced polarization is reproduced if these auxiliary particles are allowed to relax instantaneously to their local energy minima for any given fixed configuration of the atoms in the system. In practice, such treatment is computationally prohibitive for generating molecular dynamics trajectories because the electric field must be recalculated several times iteratively to satisfy the SCF condition, and it is important to seek a more efficient way to simulate the classical Drude oscillator model. It is demonstrated that a close approximation to the SCF regime can be simulated efficiently by considering the dynamics of an extended Lagrangian in which a small mass is attributed to the auxiliary particles, and the amplitude of their oscillations away from the local energy minimum is controlled with a low-temperature thermostat. A simulation algorithm in this modified two-temperature isobaric–isothermal ensemble is developed. The algorithm is tested and illustrated using a rigid three-site water model with one additional Drude particle attached to the oxygen which is closely related to the polarizable SPC model of Ahlström et al. [Mol. Phys. 68, 563 (1989)]. The tests with the extended Lagrangian show that stable and accurate molecular dynamics trajectories for large integration time steps (1 or 2 fs) can be generated and that liquid properties equivalent to SCF molecular dynamics can be reproduced at a fraction of the computational cost.}",

abstract = {Abstract Recent development of the Drude polarizable (Drude) force field (FF), based on the extension of an induced dipole model, has reached a milestone in the past few years providing a complete set of polarizable parameters for proteins, water, ions, and many lipid types. This FF enables stable simulations up to microseconds, surpassing the capability of other polarizable FFs. The quality of the Drude FF, however, has remained largely untested for modeling the secondary structures of small peptides in explicit solvents compared with classical non-polarizable FFs. It is critical to benchmark the complex and mutually dependent dynamics of hydrogen-bond (H-bond) networks formed by water–water, protein–water, and protein–protein interactions that are expected to have a major impact on the stability of protein structures and their conformational space. Here, a direct comparison is presented between the current Drude FF and the CHARMM-36 non-polarizable classical FF for 1) the solvation free energy of mimetics for all amino acid side-chain equivalents, 2) limited conformational space, 3) protein–water and protein–protein interactions, and 4) the comparative lifetimes of H-bonds. The impact of counterions on the stabilization of secondary structure in model peptides is additionally discussed and compared between these FFs.},

abstract  ="Membrane undulations play a vital role in many biological processes{,} including the regulation of membrane protein activity. The asymmetric lipid composition of most biological membranes complicates theoretical description of these bending fluctuations{,} yet experimental data that would inform any such a theory is scarce. Here{,} we used neutron spin-echo (NSE) spectroscopy to measure the bending fluctuations of large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) having an asymmetric transbilayer distribution of high- and low-melting lipids. The asymmetric vesicles were prepared using cyclodextrin-mediated lipid exchange{,} and were composed of an outer leaflet enriched in egg sphingomyelin (ESM) and an inner leaflet enriched in 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphoethanolamine (POPE){,} which have main transition temperatures of 37 °C and 25 °C{,} respectively. The overall membrane bending rigidity was measured at three temperatures: 15 °C{,} where both lipids are in a gel state; 45 °C{,} where both lipids are in a fluid state; and 30 °C{,} where there is gel-fluid co-existence. Remarkably{,} the dynamics for the fluid asymmetric LUVs (aLUVs) at 30 °C and 45 °C do not follow trends predicted by their symmetric counterparts. At 30 °C{,} compositional asymmetry suppressed the bending fluctuations{,} with the asymmetric bilayer exhibiting a larger bending modulus than that of symmetric bilayers corresponding to either the outer or inner leaflet. We conclude that the compositional asymmetry and leaflet coupling influence the internal dissipation within the bilayer and result in membrane properties that cannot be directly predicted from corresponding symmetric bilayers."}

Herein, we have applied constant-pH molecular dynamics and free-energy-sampling methods to investigate fluoride permeation through a Fluc protein from Escherichia coli. We find that fluoride is facile to permeate in its charged form, i.e., F−, by traversing through a non-bonded network. The extraordinary F− selectivity is gained by the hydrogen-bonding capability of the central binding site and the Coulombic filter at the channel entrance. The F− permeation rate calculated using an electronically polarizable force field is significantly more accurate compared with the experimental value than that calculated using a more standard additive force field, suggesting an essential role for electronic polarization in the F−–Fluc interactions.}
